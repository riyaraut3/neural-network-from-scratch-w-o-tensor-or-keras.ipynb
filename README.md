# neural-network-from-scratch-w-o-tensor-or-keras.ipynb
This project implements a simple neural network from scratch using only basic Python libraries like `numpy`. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to classify these digits accurately.
